# Q1. Write a program that takes salary as input. Using conditional statements, 
# calculate the final tax rate based on these rules:
# • If salary < 30,000 → 5%
# • If salary is 30,000–70,000 → 15%
# • If salary > 70,000 → 25%
salary= int(input("Enter your salary: "))
if salary <= 30000:
    print("The final tax rate according to your salary is 5%")
elif (salary > 30000 and salary<70000):
    print("The final tax rate according to your salary is 15%")
else:
    print("The final tax rate according to your salary is 25%")
